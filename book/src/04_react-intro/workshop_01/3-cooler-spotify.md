# [BONUS Exercise 3] The cooler spotify

hey remember that [spotify figma](../../03_figma/index.md) from last week? yeah now recreate that in react B-)

`(Unless you already know react, don't worry about adding any functionality - just attempt recreating it with your own dummy data)`

orr you could just mess around and make something that seems interesting to you!

Other things that you could try to design/make could be:
- Todo list
- Recreate your personal profile with react
